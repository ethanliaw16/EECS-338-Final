# EECS-338-Final

Instant Messaging Program

This program uses socket communication between a 
server and a client to create a messaging environment between two users.

The main data structure we are using is a buffer array that holds input from
each user and sends it to the other user via server-client communication.

server.c - this file creates a socket and a server for the client to connect to
client.c - this file connects to the previously created server and this connection
	is what allows the instant messaging to happen.

So far, both partners have worked on the code. Ethan worked on the sample 
output, and Alan worked on the design document. 

Our sample output that will theoretically happen is included in the ExampleOutput.txt
file. We are also considering adding the possibility of a three-way chat.
